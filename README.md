**Stream API and lambda practise**

The following tasks were performed on the topic of Stream API:
1) Reading and writing a file line by line in String.
2) A function that takes an array of integers as input and uses the Stream API to output only even numbers.
3) A function that accepts as input a list of lines and uses the Stream API to convert each line to uppercase
4) A function that accepts a list of numbers as input and finds their sum using the Stream API collapse method.
5) A function that accepts as input a list of lines and sorts them by the length of the lines using the Stream API sorting method.
6) A function that takes as input a list of words and uses the Stream API to check whether all words begin with a certain letter
7) A function that accepts as input a list of objects, some of which may be null, and uses the Stream API to filter only non-null objects.
8) A function that accepts a list of Strings as input and uses the Stream API to remove duplicates.

The following tasks were performed on the topic of Lambda:
1) Filtering students by score.
2) Sorted students by name
3) Sorted students by score
4) Get sum of score of all students

The correct work of the functions was checked by JUnit tests.
